## Association between ambient black carbon and temperature and High-density lipoprotein

Author: Yuhong Hu

Based on the part of the Veterans Administration Normative Aging Study (1995-2011), the project aimed to address the following questions.

1. Is daily ambient black carbon associated with HDL level? Is there lag effect for the association of interest?

2. Is daily ambient temperature associated with HDL level? Is there lag effect for the association of interest?

3. What are potential 'risk factors' of HDL changes among study population?

4. Does these risk factors modify the association between daily ambient black carbon/temperature and HDL level?
